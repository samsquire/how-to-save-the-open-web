# How to save the open web?

I really like what I call the "the volunteer web" which is the world wide web that was user generated and filled with nostalgia from the year 1999-2000 which is when my history with the web starts. There was phpBB web based community forums, Geocities, Tripod, AngelFire, Expages which were web hosts filled with quirky fan websites.

Computer magazines taught basic HTML and notepad, Microsoft FrontPage and Namo WebEditor (my favourite) could be used to create websites.

There was link aggregator websites such as Digg. Delicious let you share your bookmarks. Firefox browser extensions such as StumbleUpon which helped you explore the world web web by jumping to a random web page, Slashdot shared interesting tech news. There was so much interesting content and communities that you could surf onto.

# where is everyone nowadays?

Where is the mass of people nowadays? Are they all on Reddit? Hacker News? Reddit? Facebook? YouTube? Are people no longer creating blog posts and articles? I think the world wide web is fragmented and attention is divided. Whereas we previously had an mass of people congregating on Digg or Slashdot, they're now spread out to more places. Long timers that would contribute have stopped.

# I want to commission high quality content

Some people write interesting and high quality articles. I like articles filled with wisdom. Take these example bloggers for example:

| Blogger       | Website                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Eric Sink     | https://ericsink.com/                                        |
| Joe Duffy     | [https://joeduffyblog.com/](https://joeduffyblog.com/)       |
| Raymond Chen  | [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/) |
| Jeff Atwood   | [https://blog.codinghorror.com/](https://blog.codinghorror.com/) |
| Joel Spolsky  | [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) |
| Martin Fowler | [https://martinfowler.com/](https://martinfowler.com/)       |

We want to encourage them to do it again and again. An average web page or blog post does not have the same credence as an academic whitepaper.

What do WordPress blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit all suffer from? Moderation and spam issues. If you want to see good content, you need some way to filter out negative or harmful things you don't want to see. I think the answer is private curation.

In blogs of the previous era, there was blogrolls listed on the side of webpages where we would link to blogs that we enjoy. On Twitter we can follow and lists. On Facebook we have friends.

We want to reward positive, good behaviour. If people are required to maintain and update servers, keypairs, blog software and static site generator stacks, will that be friction that prevents them from writing?

# The time, resources and money problem

You have to reveal lots of value to get someone to even think of paying or contributing their time for something. People's attention on the web is a limited commodity. People have work. People shut web pages, uninstall applications the instant they feel they're not getting value or something happens that annoys them.

Newspaper, news, media organisations, social networks, social media and video sharing websites are struggling and they react by putting up paywalls, and advertisements which users don't like and try to circumvent.

It's just so tragic if for the fact that the underlying problem is maybe this:

```
To get people to contribute or pay, you have to give them something first so they know it's valuable.
```

Advertisements, free services, freemium, direct marketing are attempts at implementing this solution. But people don't like them.

The next problem is:

```
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
```

This is why the volunteer web is so good. It's a free lunch paid by strangers all over the world who provide something that you like, for free.

# Is the open web an investment problem?

I'm going to take a slight detour.

People rarely buy things sight unseen. But would you put lots of effort into something for an uncertain reward?

Would you put lots of effort into something for no reward, i.e, give it away for free?
