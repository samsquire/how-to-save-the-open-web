# How to save the open web?

I really like what I call the "the volunteer web" which is the world wide web that was user generated and filled with nostalgia from the year 1999-2000 which is when my history with the web starts. There was phpBB web based community forums, Geocities, Tripod, AngelFire, Expages which were web hosts filled with quirky fan websites.

Computer magazines taught basic HTML and Microsoft FrontPage and Namo webeditor could be used to create websites.

There was link aggregator websites such as Digg. Delicious let you share your bookmarks. Firefox browser extensions such as StumbleUpon which helped you explore the world web web, Slashdot. There was so much interesting content and communities that you could surf onto.
